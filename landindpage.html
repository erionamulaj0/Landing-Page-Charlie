          <h1>Charlie Chaplin</h1>
          <p>
            Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin Jr. KBE (16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977) was an English comic actor,
            filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film. He became a worldwide icon through his
            screen persona, the Tramp, and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film
            industry. His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his
            death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.

      <div class="biography-info">
        <p>harles Spencer Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (née Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr., both
          of whom had Romanichal heritage. There is no official record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was
          born at East Street, Walworth, in South London. His parents had married four years previously, at which time
          Charles Sr. became the legal guardian of Hannah's illegitimate son, Sydney John Hill.At the time of his birth,
          Chaplin's parents were both music hall entertainers. Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker, had a brief and
          unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley, while Charles Sr., a butcher's son, was a popular
          singer.Although they never divorced, Chaplin's parents were estranged by around 1891. The following year,
          Hannah gave birth to a third son, George Wheeler Dryden, fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden.
          The child was taken by Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter Chaplin's life for thirty
          years.Chaplin's childhood was fraught with poverty and hardship, making his eventual trajectory "the most
          dramatic of all the rags to riches stories ever told" according to his authorised biographer David
          Robinson.Chaplin's early years were spent with his mother and brother Sydney in the London district of
          Kennington; Hannah had no means of income, other than occasional nursing and dressmaking, and Chaplin Sr.
          provided no financial support. As the situation deteriorated, Chaplin was sent to Lambeth Workhouse when he
          was seven years old. The council housed him at the Central London District School for paupers, which Chaplin
          remembered as "a forlorn existence".He was briefly reunited with his mother 18 months later, before Hannah was
          forced to readmit her family to the workhouse in July 1898. The boys were promptly sent to Norwood Schools,
          another institution for destitute children.<em>For more you can click</em> <a

        <div class="quote">
          <p>“I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer
            anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one
            another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery.
            We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone, and the good earth
            is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.
            Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and
            bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left
            us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel
            too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.
            Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The airplane and the radio have brought
            us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for
            universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world,
            millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and
            imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is
            but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will
            pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as
            men die, liberty will never perish. Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave
            you; who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel! Who drill you, diet you,
            treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men
            with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men! You have the
            love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate; the unloved and the unnatural.
            Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the seventeenth chapter of St. Luke, it is written
            that the kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the
            people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have
            the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of
            democracy, let us use that power. Let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will
            give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these
            things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will!
            Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfill that promise. Let us
            fight to free the world! To do away with national barriers! To do away with greed, with hate and
            intolerance! Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's
            happiness. Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!”</p>
